# Mobile Optimizations Implemented

This document outlines the mobile-specific optimizations implemented for the Cross Country Timer app.

## Viewport Configuration

### Enhanced Viewport Meta Tags

- Added `viewportFit: "cover"` for devices with notches/dynamic islands
- Added `themeColor: "#ffffff"` for browser UI theming
- Maintained `userScalable: false` to prevent accidental zoom
- Set `maximumScale: 1` to prevent zoom on double-tap

## Touch Target Optimization

### Minimum Touch Target Sizes

- **Stopwatch Button**: 112px × 112px (28 × 28 Tailwind units) on mobile, 128px × 128px on desktop
- **Split Buttons**: Minimum 48px × 48px with full-width responsive design
- **Add Runner Button**: Minimum 48px height with full-width layout
- **Input Fields**: Minimum 48px height for easy touch interaction

### Touch-Friendly Classes

- Added `.touch-target` utility class for consistent touch target sizing
- Applied `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent zoom on double-tap
- Enhanced button styling with proper focus states and active feedback

## Font Size Optimization

### iOS Zoom Prevention

- Set input field font size to 16px to prevent automatic zoom on iOS
- Used responsive text sizing: `text-4xl sm:text-6xl` for stopwatch display
- Maintained readable font sizes across all screen sizes

### Responsive Typography

- Mobile-first approach with smaller text on mobile, larger on desktop
- Proper line-height for readability on small screens
- Optimized font rendering with `-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased`

## Layout Enhancements

### Safe Area Support

- Applied safe area padding to main layout containers
- Used `100dvh` (dynamic viewport height) for better mobile browser support

### Responsive Spacing

- Reduced padding on mobile: `p-3 sm:p-4`
- Optimized grid gaps: `gap-2 sm:gap-3`
- Better content spacing for thumb-friendly navigation

## CSS Optimizations

### Mobile-Specific Styles

- Prevented horizontal scrolling with `overflow-x: hidden`
- Enhanced scrolling with `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`
- Removed tap highlight color for cleaner interaction
- Improved font smoothing for better text rendering

### Button Enhancements

- Removed default button appearance across browsers
- Added proper cursor states (pointer/not-allowed)
- Enhanced active states with scale animations
- Improved focus rings for accessibility

## Performance Optimizations

### Tailwind Configuration

- Added custom spacing utilities for safe areas
- Extended theme with mobile-specific font sizes
- Optimized for mobile-first responsive design

### Component Optimizations

- Used responsive classes throughout components
- Optimized re-rendering with proper React patterns
- Maintained smooth animations and transitions

## Testing Coverage

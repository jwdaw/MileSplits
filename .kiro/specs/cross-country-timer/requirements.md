# Requirements Document

## Introduction

A mobile-friendly web application designed for cross country coaches to track individual runner splits during 5K races. The app provides a master stopwatch and individual timing capabilities to capture mile splits (1 mile, 2 mile, 3 mile) for multiple runners simultaneously without requiring manual lap time calculations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a cross country coach, I want to add runners to my timing session, so that I can track their individual splits during a race.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the app THEN the system SHALL display an input field to enter runner names
2. WHEN I enter a runner name and submit THEN the system SHALL add the runner to a visible list
3. WHEN I add a runner THEN the system SHALL create an individual timing row for that runner
4. WHEN I have multiple runners added THEN the system SHALL display all runners in a table format

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a cross country coach, I want a master stopwatch that I can start and stop, so that I can control the timing session for all runners.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the app THEN the system SHALL display a prominent stopwatch at the top of the screen
2. WHEN I tap the start button THEN the system SHALL begin timing and start all individual runner timers
3. WHEN the stopwatch is running THEN the system SHALL display the elapsed time in real-time
4. WHEN I tap the stop button THEN the system SHALL pause all timing including individual runner timers
5. WHEN the stopwatch is stopped THEN the system SHALL allow me to restart timing from the paused state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cross country coach, I want to record individual mile splits for each runner, so that I can track their performance at 1 mile, 2 mile, and 3 mile marks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the master stopwatch is running THEN each runner SHALL have individual split buttons for mile 1, 2, and 3
2. WHEN I tap a runner's mile split button THEN the system SHALL record their current elapsed time for that mile
3. WHEN a split is recorded THEN the system SHALL display the split time in the runner's row
4. WHEN a split is recorded THEN the system SHALL disable that specific split button for that runner
5. WHEN all three splits are recorded for a runner THEN the system SHALL show their complete split progression

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cross country coach, I want the app to be mobile-friendly and work on my iPhone, so that I can use it trackside during races.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the app on an iPhone THEN the system SHALL display all content within the screen boundaries without horizontal scrolling
2. WHEN I use the app on mobile THEN all buttons SHALL be large enough for easy touch interaction
3. WHEN I view the app on mobile THEN the text SHALL be readable without zooming
4. WHEN I rotate my phone THEN the app SHALL remain functional and properly formatted

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cross country coach, I want the app built with NextJS and deployable immediately, so that I can use it for upcoming races.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app is built THEN it SHALL use NextJS framework
2. WHEN the app is completed THEN it SHALL be deployable to a hosting platform without additional configuration
3. WHEN deployed THEN the app SHALL function identically to the development version
4. WHEN accessed via web browser THEN the app SHALL load quickly and be responsive

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a cross country coach, I want a simple and intuitive interface, so that I can focus on timing rather than navigating complex features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I first open the app THEN the interface SHALL be immediately understandable without instructions
2. WHEN I use the app THEN all primary functions SHALL be accessible with single taps
3. WHEN timing is active THEN the most important information SHALL be prominently displayed
4. WHEN I make an error THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback without disrupting the timing session

## Post-Deployment Requirements (Based on Real-World Usage)

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a cross country coach, I want the stopwatch to be compact and not dominate my mobile screen, so that I can see runner splits without scrolling during races.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I view the app on mobile THEN the stopwatch SHALL occupy minimal vertical space while remaining easily accessible
2. WHEN I have 8+ runners added THEN the runner splits SHALL be visible without scrolling on standard mobile devices
3. WHEN I use the app during a race THEN the split recording buttons SHALL be the primary visual focus
4. WHEN I interact with the stopwatch THEN it SHALL maintain minimum 44px touch targets for accessibility

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a cross country coach, I want to reset the timer and clear all data between races, so that I can use the app for multiple races without browser refresh.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I finish timing a race THEN the system SHALL provide a reset option to clear all data
2. WHEN I initiate a reset THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation to prevent accidental data loss
3. WHEN I confirm a reset THEN the system SHALL clear the timer, all runners, and localStorage data
4. WHEN a reset is complete THEN the system SHALL return to the initial app state ready for a new race
5. WHEN I reset the app THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback confirming the reset was successful
